## üí° The Story

I graduated from UMD and remember the struggle: hunting for study materials before exams, relying on fragmented GroupMe chats, and watching resources get lost semester after semester. **Notes that could help hundreds of students were trapped in individual Google Drives.**

I built **Terp Notes** to solve this problem‚Äîa centralized, searchable repository where Terps help Terps succeed. Whether you need CMSC330 lecture notes, MATH141 practice problems, or HIST156 study guides, it's all here. **Free. Always.**

This platform is **built for students, by a student** (now alum), with zero profit motive. Just Terps helping Terps. üê¢

**Note:** Terp Notes is an independent platform‚Äînot affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to the University of Maryland.

## Architecture Highlights

### **Why These Design Decisions?**

**Class-Based Organization**
Students think in courses ("I need CMSC330 notes"), not file types. The entire platform is organized around UMD's class code structure.

**Client-Side Filtering**
Load file metadata once, filter in-browser. Instant search without server delays.

**Direct S3 Uploads**
Files upload directly to AWS S3, bypassing Vercel's 4.5MB limit. Supports files up to 5GB!

**Background Virus Scanning**
Files upload immediately (fast UX), then scan asynchronously. No waiting for security checks.

**File Deduplication**
Same file uploaded by multiple users? Stored once in S3, referenced multiple times in MongoDB. Saves storage costs.

**Email Normalization**
`@umd.edu` and `@terpmail.umd.edu` route to the same inbox, preventing duplicate accounts.

**Role-Based Moderation**
Instead of banning violators, revoke upload privileges ("Viewer" mode). Encourages rehabilitation over punishment.
